        <p class="dan">Attorney Daniel Zaharevich is an analytical lawyer who assists individuals, investors, and businesses with a wide range of real estate matters, contract questions, and legal disputes. His progress as the principal of Zaharevich Law Office is attributable both to his loyal service and to his ability to find meaningful options that make sense.
        </p> 
        <p class="dan">His intent is always to achieve the most favorable outcome for those he represents and therefore zealously seeks resolutions to that end. Dan focuses his practice on residential and commercial real estate transactions, residential and commercial leases, general business matters, contract disputes, and civil litigation. In addition to his legal knowledge, Dan is a reputable real estate professional with experience in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
        <p class="dan">Dan graduated magna cum laude from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University with a bachelor of aeronautical science degree in 2004. Years later, he earned a master’s degree in business administration from Troy University. He went on to attend law school at George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia, when he clerked for the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the law school’s Legal Clinic for Military Service Members and Veterans. Before he created Zaharevich Law Office, Dan worked as a legal fellow in D.C. Superior Court and as a special attorney at the District of Columbia Office of the Attorney General.
        </p>
